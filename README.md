# PyRSA
This Python project demonstrates the implementation of the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages. RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers. This project provides a simple yet effective example of how RSA encryption and decryption works.
