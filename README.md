# PyRSA
This Python project demonstrates the implementation of the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages. RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers. This project provides a simple yet effective example of how RSA encryption and decryption works.

## Introduction
RSA encryption is a public-key cryptosystem that uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This project showcases a Python implementation of RSA encryption and decryption, allowing users to securely encrypt messages using a public key and decrypt them using the corresponding private key.

## Installation
To use this project, you'll need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitqadir/PyRSA.git
```
Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd PyRSA
```
## Usage
To encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA, follow these steps:

Run PyRSA.py script.
Enter prime numbers in the terminal when prompted.
View all the RSA alogirthm parameters printed in terminal.
